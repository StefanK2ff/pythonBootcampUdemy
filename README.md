# pythonBootcampUdemy

## Intro: 

This structure and the code base is the course material of a [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-bootcamp) provided by [Jannis Seemann](https://github.com/jannis-seemann). I already did some changes to the course material during my code-along without using git. So my changes to the inital codebase is not visible here for chapter 1 - 14.

Working with pycharm (lection 15) is a separate repo here on [my github](https://github.com/StefanK2ff/pythonBootcampUdemy)

My changes to the course material will start with *chapter 16*.
